Hello! 👋

I'm a student at Seattle Central College pursuing an **Associate's of Science**, preparing to transfer to university in 2026. My academic work centers on building a strong foundation in **mathematics, computer science fundamentals, and quantitative reasoning**.

My aim is to leverage these analytical skills in challenging roles requiring collaboration, computational proficiency, and deep quantitative understanding.

* **Learning:** Foundational Calculus & Statistics, Python (Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy).
* **Interests:** Applying quantitative methods, data analysis & modeling, financial market dynamics, business strategy, and collaborative problem-solving.
* **Tools:** Python, Go, SQL, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Git, and interesting API's.

💬 Open to discussing: data modelling, market research, potential collaborations, or the business applications of quantitative techniques.
