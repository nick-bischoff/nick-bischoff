👋 Hello or Bonjour !

I'm a student at Seattle Central College pursuing an Associate's of Science (DTA), preparing to transfer to university in 2026. 
My academic work centers on building a strong foundation in **mathematics, computer science fundamentals, and quantitative reasoning**.

My aim is to leverage these skills in challenging analytical roles requiring deep quantitative understanding and computational proficiency.

*   🌱 **Learning:** Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, Python (for data analysis - NumPy, Pandas), SQL basics, core CS concepts.
*   🔍 **Interests:** Applying quantitative methods to complex problems, data analysis & modeling, financial market dynamics, problem-solving through code.
*   ⚙️ **Tools:** Python, SQL, Git – viewing programming as a key tool for analysis and modeling.

💬 Open to discussing quantitative analysis, data-driven problem solving, Python for data science, the intersection of math and computation, **potential collaborations**, or the **business applications of quantitative techniques**.
